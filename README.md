# RSC-Replication
RSC-Replication is a PyTorch-based replication of the Representation Self-Challenging (RSC) method. It improves cross-domain generalization by identifying and masking dominant feature representations during training, forcing the network to leverage remaining features and learn more robust, transferable patterns without adding extra parameters.
